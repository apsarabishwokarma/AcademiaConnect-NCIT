#Here is a simple Python code for a login page that takes input from the user for a username and password and compares it to a predefined set of valid credentials.



# Define valid credentials
valid_username = "admin"
valid_password = "password"

# Get input from user
username = input("Enter your username: ")
password = input("Enter your password: ")

# Check if input matches valid credentials
if username == valid_username and password == valid_password:
    print("Access granted.")
else:
    print("Access denied. Invalid username or password.")


#This is just a simple example and in the real world, it is not recommended to hardcode the credentials and it is better to use some kind of database to store the credentials.
Also, it is highly recommended to use encryption to store the passwords.
