#Here is a simple Python code for a login page that takes input from the user for a username and password and compares it to a predefined set of valid credentials.



# Define valid credentials
valid_username = "admin"
valid_password = "password"

# Get input from user
username = input("Enter your username: ")
password = input("Enter your password: ")

# Check if input matches valid credentials
if username == valid_username and password == valid_password:
    print("Access granted.")
else:
    print("Access denied. Invalid username or password.")
